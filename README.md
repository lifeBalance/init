## Network
### Exercise 01
**Question**: Get the list of the network interfaces of the machine without displaying any detail
for these interfaces. Only the list of names.

* **Explanation**: `ifconfig` (short for interface configuration) is a command-line tool for configuring the **network interface**. It provides a lot of options such as `up` (to enable an interface) or `down` (to disable it). The `-l` flag may be used to **list** all available interfaces on the system by **name**, with no other additional information.

* **Script**: Check `01`.

### Exercise 02
**Question**: Identify and display the Ethernet interface characteristics:
(a) Identify broadcast address
(b) Identify all IP adresses which are part of the same subnet

* **Explanation**: Usually in Linux/Unix systems, the **ethernet** interface is descriptively labeled with the prefix `eth`; so we'd have `eth0` for the first one, `eth1` for the second one, and so on. Another convention is to label them as `enp0s69`, where `en` stands for ethernet, then its **port** number, then its **slot** number. On the other hand, **wireless** interfaces are labeled with the `wl` (short for wireless) prefix, followed by its **port number** and its **slot number**, such as `wlp3s0`

In **macOS**, network interfaces start with `en0`, `en1`, and so on. From the name itself we don't have a clue if we're dealing with an **ethernet** or a **wireless** card, so we don't have a choice but to visit **System Preferences**, then **Network**, and on the sidebar select the interface we're interested on, and compare its **MAC address** with the output of `ifconfig`.

On systems with both an **ethernet** and **wireless** card, `en0` represents the **ethernet interface** and `en1` the **wireless one**. The **MAC address** is a bit confusingly preceded by the word `ether` for both **wireless** and **ethernet** cards, but that's due to the fact that **Wi-Fi** and **ethernet** both adhere to the **IEEE 802** standard for **local area networks**.

> On systems with just a wireless connection (like my MacBook Air), `en0` represents the **wireless interface**.

* **Script**: Check `02`. On the script I used a function named `get_broadcast_address` to get the broadcast address of the **ethernet interface** (`en0`). Then used the first **bytes** of this address to filter all the IP addresses in the same **subnet**.

### Exercise 03
**Question**: Identify the MAC address of the Wi-Fi card.

* **Explanation**: Since the school computers have both **ethernet** and **wireless** cards, in this case we need to specify the `en1` interface, `grep` the line with `ethernet`, and filter the second field.

* **Script**: Check `03`.

### Exercise 04
**Question**: Identifiy the default gateway in the routing table.

* **Explanation**: In computer networking, a **routing table**, is a data table stored in a router or a network host that lists the routes to particular network destinations. The routing table contains information about the topology of the network immediately around it. We can use the `netstat` command (short for network statistics) to get information about the network we're connected to. The `-r` flag is used to display the **routing table**, and the **default gateway** is clearly labeled as `default`, so we just have to do a bit of text filtering and done.

* **Script**: Check `04`.

### Exercise 05
**Question**: Identify the IP address of the DNS that responds to the following url: who.int.

* **Explanation**: A **DNS server** is a computer server that contains a database of public IP addresses and their associated hostnames, and in most cases serves to resolve, or translate, those **names** to **IP addresses** as requested. The `nslookup` command allows us to query Internet servers for information; if we pass a hostname (in this case `who.int`) as argument it will give us the IP to what that hostname resolves, but also the **Domain Name Server** used to translate the name to the IP. We just have to filter the result a bit to get just the IP address of the DNS.

* **Script**: Check `05`.

### Exercise 06
**Question**: Get the complete path of the file that contains the IP address of the DNS server
youâ€™re using.

* **Explanation**: `resolv.conf` is the name of a a plain-text file used in various operating systems to configure the system's Domain Name System (DNS) resolver. In **macOS** this file is located under the `/etc` folder, hence the **full path** is `/etc/resolv.conf`.

* **Answer**: No script was asked, just a file (`06`) with the name mentioned above.

### Exercise 07
Query an external DNS server on the who.int domain name (ie.: google 8.8.8.8)

* **Explanation**: We can provide `nslookup` with a **second argument**: the **name server** to be used to check a **domain name** given as **first argument** (who.int). Without the second argument, `nslookup` will check the **default name server** (the one configured in `/etc/resolv.conf`).

* **Script**: Check `07`.

### Exercise 08
Find the provider of who.int

* **Explanation**: We first use the `nslookup` command to get the IP address of the who.int hostname. Then we feed that IP to the `whois` command. Finally, we add a bit of text processing magic and voila.

> A comfortable way of getting the IP of a domain is to google a site such as [hosting checker](https://hostingchecker.com/), but we chose the dark way ;-)

* **Answer**: Check `08` (it contains a script and the answer in a **comment**).

### Exercise 09
Find the external IP of 42.fr

* **Explanation**: Basically just using `nslookup` and a bit of text filtering fun (I reused the function of the last exercise).

* **Script**: Check `09`.

### Exercise 10
Identify the network devices between your computer and the who.int domain.

* **Explanation**: For that we can use the `traceroute` command, which prints the route that the packets take till the network host.

* **Script**: Check `10`.

### Exercise 11
Use the output of the previous command to find the name and IP address of the device that makes the link between you (local network) and the outside world.

* **Explanation**: From the output of `traceroute who.int` we can deduce that the **first hop** is the **IP** of the device that links our local network and the outside world. We can confirm that checking the **routing tables** using `netstat -rn`.

* **Answer**: NO script was asked. Check file `11` for the **answer**.

### Exercise 12
Find the IP that was assigned to you by dhcp server.

* **Explanation**: The `ipconfig` command communicates with the IPConfiguration agent to **retrieve** and **set** IP configuration parameters. In this case we need the IP that the DHCP server assigned to the interface that we use to connect to the network. Since we're connected using the **ethernet** interface (cable), we need to use the `getifaddr` to get the IP address of the `en0` interface.

> **DHCP** stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol. All machines that belong to a network, are assigned **dynamic IP addresses** by a DHCP server.

* **Script**: Check `12`.

### Exercise 13
Thanks to the previous question and the reverse DNS find the name of your host.

* **Explanation**: We just have to use the command-line we wrote in the previous exercise as an argument to `nslookup` (it will only work if the network has set up a **reverse DNS lookup** or [rDNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_DNS_lookup) for short).

> `networksetup -getcomputername` and `hostname` are easy ways of getting the name of our host.

* **Script**:  Check `13`.

### Exercise 14
What file contains the local DNS entries?

* **Explanation**: The [hosts file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_(file)) is where the system maps **hostnames** to **IP addresses**. In Linux/Unix systems it's located in the `/etc` folder, hence the **full path** to this file is `/etc/hosts`.

* **Script**: **NO SCRIPT**. Check file `14` for the **answer**.

### Exercise 15
Make the intra.42.fr address reroute to 46.19.122.85

* **Explanation**: To bypass the DNS server, we can add mapping of **hostnames** to **IP addresses** by adding additional lines to the `/etc/hosts` file.

* **Script**: Check file `15`.

> Since we need **superuser** privileges to edit the `/etc/hosts` file, in order to execute the command line in file `15` we would need to run: `sudo sh 15`

## System
### Exercise 01
In what file can you find the installed version of your Debian?

* **Answer**: In `/etc/debian_version`

### Exercise 02
What command can you use to rename your system?

* **Explanation**: In Linux, the `hostnamectl` command may be used to **query** and **change** the system hostname and related settings.

* **Script**: Check file `02`.

### Exercise 03
What file has to be modified to make it permanent?

* **Explanation**: That file is `/etc/hostname` which contains the name of the machine, used by applications that run locally. That name can be retrieved by the `hostname` command, and temporarily changed by the `hostnamectl` command.

* **Answer**: Check file `03`.
