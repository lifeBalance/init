## Network
### Exercise 01
**Question**: Get the list of the network interfaces of the machine without displaying any detail
for these interfaces. Only the list of names.

* **Explanation**: `ifconfig` (short for interface configuration) is a command-line tool for configuring the **network interface**. It provides a lot of options such as `up` (to enable an interface) or `down` (to disable it). The `-l` flag may be used to **list** all available interfaces on the system by **name**, with no other additional information.

* **Script**: Check `01`.

### Exercise 02
**Question**: Identify and display the Ethernet interface characteristics:
(a) Identify broadcast address
(b) Identify all IP adresses which are part of the same subnet

* **Explanation**: Usually in Linux/Unix systems, the **ethernet** interface is descriptively labeled with the prefix `eth`; so we'd have `eth0` for the first one, `eth1` for the second one, and so on. Another convention is to label them as `enp0s69`, where `en` stands for ethernet, then its **port** number, then its **slot** number. On the other hand, **wireless** interfaces are labeled with the `wl` (short for wireless) prefix, followed by its **port number** and its **slot number**, such as `wlp3s0`

In **macOS**, network interfaces start with `en0`, `en1`, and so on. From the name itself we don't have a clue if we're dealing with an **ethernet** or a **wireless** card, so we don't have a choice but to visit **System Preferences**, then **Network**, and on the sidebar select the interface we're interested on, and compare its **MAC address** with the output of `ifconfig`.

On systems with both an **ethernet** and **wireless** card, `en0` represents the **ethernet interface** and `en1` the **wireless one**. The **MAC address** is a bit confusingly preceded by the word `ether` for both **wireless** and **ethernet** cards, but that's due to the fact that **Wi-Fi** and **ethernet** both adhere to the **IEEE 802** standard for **local area networks**.

> On systems with just a wireless connection (like my MacBook Air), `en0` represents the **wireless interface**.

* **Script**: Check `02`. On the script I used a function named `get_broadcast_address` to get the broadcast address of the **ethernet interface** (`en0`). Then used the first **bytes** of this address to filter all the IP addresses in the same **subnet**.

### Exercise 03
**Question**: Identify the MAC address of the Wi-Fi card.

* **Explanation**: Since the school computers have both **ethernet** and **wireless** cards, in this case we need to specify the `en1` interface, `grep` the line with `ethernet`, and filter the second field.

* **Script**: Check `03`.

### Exercise 04
**Question**: Identifiy the default gateway in the routing table.

* **Explanation**: In computer networking, a **routing table**, is a data table stored in a router or a network host that lists the routes to particular network destinations. The routing table contains information about the topology of the network immediately around it. We can use the `netstat` command (short for network statistics) to get information about the network we're connected to. The `-r` flag is used to display the **routing table**, and the **default gateway** is clearly labeled as `default`, so we just have to do a bit of text filtering and done.

* **Script**: Check `04`.

### Exercise 05
**Question**: Identify the IP address of the DNS that responds to the following url: who.int.

* **Explanation**: A **DNS server** is a computer server that contains a database of public IP addresses and their associated hostnames, and in most cases serves to resolve, or translate, those **names** to **IP addresses** as requested. The `nslookup` command allows us to query Internet servers for information; if we pass a hostname (in this case `who.int`) as argument it will give us the IP to what that hostname resolves, but also the **Domain Name Server** used to translate the name to the IP. We just have to filter the result a bit to get just the IP address of the DNS.

* **Script**: Check `05`.

### Exercise 06
**Question**: Get the complete path of the file that contains the IP address of the DNS server
youâ€™re using.

* **Explanation**: `resolv.conf` is the name of a a plain-text file used in various operating systems to configure the system's Domain Name System (DNS) resolver. In **macOS** this file is located under the `/etc` folder, hence the **full path** is `/etc/resolv.conf`.

* **Script**: No script was asked, just a file (`06`) with the name mentioned above.

### Exercise 07
Query an external DNS server on the who.int domain name (ie.: google 8.8.8.8)

* **Explanation**: We can provide `nslookup` with a **second argument**: the **name server** to be used to check a **domain name** given as **first argument** (who.int). Without the second argument, `nslookup` will check the **default name server** (the one configured in `/etc/resolv.conf`).

* **Script**: Check `07`.

### Exercise 08
Find the provider of who.int

* **Explanation**: We first use the `nslookup` command to get the IP address of the who.int hostname. Then we feed that IP to the `whois` command. Finally, we add a bit of text processing magic and voila.

* **Script**: Check `08` (it contains the answer in a **comment**).

### Exercise 09
Find the external IP of 42.fr

* **Explanation**: Basically just using `nslookup` and a bit of text filtering fun (I reused the function of the last exercise).

* **Script**: Check `09`.

### Exercise 10
Identify the network devices between your computer and the who.int domain

* **Explanation**: For that we can use the `traceroute` command, which prints the route that the packets take till the network host.

* **Script**: Check `10`.
